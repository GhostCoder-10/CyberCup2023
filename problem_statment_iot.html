            <p>
                Design an IoT based wearable location tracker and chatbot. 
                The wearable product could be hand-band, necklace or a jacket 
                which may be used to track the subject even in case of emergency
                situation such as theft or a professional loosing his car or
                environmental extreme. The product/device should be able to answer
                user query in different local languages/ dialects. The designed 
                system should be smart enough to understand and answer queries from
                user who suffer change in instructions due to mood/tone/health condition.
